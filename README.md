High level guidelines:

* Be consistent.
* Don't rewrite existing code to follow this guide.
* Don't violate a guideline without a good reason.
* A reason is good when you can convince a teammate.

If you disagree with a guideline, open an issue on the guides repo rather than debating it within the
code review. In the meantime, apply the guideline.
